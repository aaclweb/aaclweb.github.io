title: "NLP in Latin America Survey"
root: ../../
---

If you are a researcher in Natural Language Processing from or in
Latin America (as defined as Central America, South America and the
Caribbean), we want to get your feedback and opinions on what role, if
any, NAACL could play in helping grow NLP in Latin America.  To this
end, we circulated this survey this winter, but understand some people
might not have yet had an opportunity to fill it out.  If you meet the
requirements, please fill it out (links below) by July 30, 2016.  We
are compiling the feedback and will share it as a report later this
summer.  The survey will take you about 10 minutes to complete.  We
have translated the survey into three languages (English, Portuguese
and Spanish); please feel free to use whichever form you are most
comfortable with:

[English](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1mL_sNShyZ2I2rj9HEiWBzKOf-Egft-zSUgLJGtNmMXs/viewform)

[Portuguese](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/149Z8_EzTHSs_ur-P51VlSL0NzfJNF-OS__ktYt-6FHw/viewform)

[Spanish](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1gMN3JJYwIOlbMJZ9PCpRCgiYzmtF87rpJI3wzVymWB8/viewform)

Also, as we want to reach as many researchers in the region as
possible, we would appreciate it if you could forward the link to your
colleagues we might have missed inadvertently, or provide us with
their email addresses so we can contact them.

Thank you for your time!
