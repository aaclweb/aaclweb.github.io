The NAACL board is currently crowdsourcing feature requests for START, the tool used to manage the proceedings of *ACL conferences. Softconf, the company that built and maintains START, has built a very nice tool around our community's extensive custom tools for producing our own proceedings; however, many of these interfaces could stand for some UI and UX improvement. Softconf has been very accommodating with different changes here and there over the years, and we plan to collect a large set of ideas for improvements and work with them on an overhaul.

Please visit this page to contribute your suggestions and feature requests:
