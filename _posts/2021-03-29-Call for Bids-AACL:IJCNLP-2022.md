The 2nd Conference of the Asia-Pacific Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 12th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing

The Asia-Pacific Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (AACL) hereby invites proposals to host the conference in the Asia-Pacific region around the beginning of December 2022.  At this time, we seek preliminary draft proposals from prospective bidders in the Asia-Pacific region. Promising bidders will be asked to provide additional information for the final selection.

The AACL/IJCNLP 2022 Coordinating Committee, made up of representatives of the AACL and representatives from the AFNLP, will select the General Chair and the Program Committee Co-Chairs for the conference. Draft proposals should identify a Local Arrangements Chair, who will work with the General Chair and the Coordinating Committee to develop a detailed plan and budget.

To facilitate conference organization, bidders may delegate many tasks of their choice to a Professional Conference Organizer and/or to the ACL Office (Priscilla Rasmussen). Handy bid guidelines, including expense and task list templates and additional useful links are provided at:
http://aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=Bid_Guidelines.
The template for local expenses is available here: http://ftp.cs.toronto.edu/pub/gh/ACL-conference-bid-template-CURRENT.xlsx.

Bid Highlights:
Draft proposals include information on the following:
- Estimates of the anticipated number of registrants
- Location (accessibility, including physical disability access; conference venue, e.g., convention center, hotel or university; accommodation; dining options; capability to host the registrants predicted)
- Safety of the region/local neighborhood (venue and proposed accommodations) for all ethnicities, sexual orientations and genders, or a plan to ensure safety
- Proposed dates. Religious and local national holidays should be avoided, as much as possible.
- Local arrangements team (chair/co-chair, committee, volunteer labor, registration handling; description of any experience the team has had in organizing previous conferences and the number of participants at those conferences)
- Local Computational Linguistics community (the size and impact of local R&D groups on NLP and related disciplines)
- Meeting venues (space for sessions, tutorials, workshops, posters, exhibits, demos, small meetings and registration)
- High-speed, all-ports-open, easy-to-use internet access
- Audiovisual equipment
- Catering, including breaks, receptions, poster sessions, banquet and entertainment (traditionally, dancing for participants at the banquet); access to food onsite for restricted diets (religious constraints/vegans/vegetarians/widespread allergies and intolerances such as gluten-free)
- Local sponsorships
- Local expenses estimates spreadsheet (using template provided, link above)

Evaluation:
Proposals will be evaluated according to the following criteria (unordered):
- Experience, flexibility, and openmindedness of local arrangements team
