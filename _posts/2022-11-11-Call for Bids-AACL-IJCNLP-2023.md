# Call for Bids - IJCNLP-AACL 2023

The 2nd Conference of the Asia-Pacific Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 12th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing.

The Asia-Pacific Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (AACL) hereby invites proposals to host the conference in the Asia-Pacific region around the beginning of December 2022.  At this time, we seek preliminary draft proposals from prospective bidders in the Asia-Pacific region. Promising bidders will be asked to provide additional information for the final selection.

The AACL/IJCNLP 2022 Coordinating Committee, made up of representatives of the AACL and representatives from the AFNLP, will select the General Chair and the Program Committee Co-Chairs for the conference. Draft proposals should identify a Local Arrangements Chair, who will work with the General Chair and the Coordinating Committee to develop a detailed plan and budget.

To facilitate conference organization, bidders may delegate many tasks of their choice to a Professional Conference Organizer. Handy bid guidelines, including expense and task list templates and additional useful links are provided at: [Bid Guidelines](http://aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=Bid_Guidelines). The template for local expenses is available here: [ACL Conference Bids Template](http://ftp.cs.toronto.edu/pub/gh/ACL-conference-bid-template-CURRENT.xlsx).

- Local arrangements team (chair/co-chair, committee, volunteer labor, registration handling; description of any experience the team has had in organizing previous conferences and the number of participants at those conferences)
- Local Computational Linguistics community (the size and impact of local R&D groups on NLP and related disciplines)
- Meeting venues (space for sessions, tutorials, workshops, posters, exhibits, demos, small meetings and registration)
- High-speed, all-ports-open, easy-to-use internet access
- Audiovisual equipment
- Catering, including breaks, receptions, poster sessions, banquet and entertainment (traditionally, dancing for participants at the banquet); access to food onsite for restricted diets (religious constraints/vegans/vegetarians/widespread allergies and intolerances such as gluten-free)
