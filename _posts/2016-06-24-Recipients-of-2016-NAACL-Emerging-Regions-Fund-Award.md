We are excited to announce the two recipients of the 2016 NAACL [Emerging Regions Fund Award](calls/emerging_regions/index.html):

* The Federal University of Juiz de Fora, to support a theme session of Computational Semantics with Frames and Constructions.
* The Instituto Caro y Cuervo and Universidad Nacional de Colombia, for the organization of a national meeting of researchers of Computational Linguistics and Corpus Linguistics.

Both recipients will receive $1,500 USD. This year was a particularly competitive year as we had a record number of submissions (11).
