Call For NAACL Scholarship Applications To The Two-Week Undergraduate Summer School At The 2018 Annual Jelinek Memorial Workshop On Speech And Language Technology (JSALT)
--------------------------------------

The North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL) is again offering an exciting summer school opportunity for a limited number of undergraduate students interested in the field of Human Language Technology.

__What is this scholarship for?__ A continuation of the [Johns Hopkins University CLSP summer workshop series](http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/) from 1995-2017, JSALT brings notable researchers and students together to collaborate on selected research topics for six weeks, following a special two-week undergraduate education session. Those first two weeks provide students with general introductions to the major areas of study within the field of Human Language Technology (e.g., Natural Language Processing, Automatic Speech Recognition, Machine Translation, Information Retrieval), as well as sessions on specialized research topics of current interest in the field.

__What does the scholarship cover?__ The NAACL scholarship is used to support undergraduate students from the Americas to participate in the __two-week summer school__. Specifically, it covers the mandatory registration and housing costs for the full duration. In addition, up to $500 will be given to the student to offset travel and other incidental costs. Additional travel support may be available for students with exceptionally high travel costs.

__Who can apply for this scholarship?__ Students must be enrolled or pre-enrolled at an institution in the Americas to qualify. Preference will be given to high-quality undergraduate students at a stage in their careers during which attendance at the summer school will provide maximum benefit; in particular, undergraduates who have completed at least their junior year of study. Graduate and Postdoctoral applications will not be accepted. Students who are selected for the summer school are expected to attend all two weeks of the summer school.

__How do I apply for this scholarship?__ Easy! Fill in the form at [https://goo.gl/forms/sGj8lyc5IJ5rMHfE3](https://goo.gl/forms/sGj8lyc5IJ5rMHfE3) and arrange for one to two short letters of reference to be sent to [naacl-jhu-workshop@googlegroups.com](mailto:naacl-jhu-workshop@googlegroups.com) by __Monday, April 30, 2018__.
