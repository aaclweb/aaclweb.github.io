### Call for Participation

The North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL) is again offering an exciting summer school opportunity for a limited number of undergraduate students interested in the field of Human Language Technology.

The 2016 Jelinek Summer Workshop will be held from Monday, June 13 to Friday, August 5, 2016 at the University of Washington at Seattle, WA. The first two weeks of the workshop, from June 13 to June 24, 2016, is a summer school that provides general introductions to the major areas of study within the field of Human Language Technology (e.g., Natural Language Processing, Automatic Speech Recognition, Machine Translation, Information Retrieval) as well as sessions on specialized research topics of current interest in the field. The NAACL scholarship is used to support undergraduate students to participate in the two-week summer school.
