#### Candidacy Statement

Looking at past candidacy statements over the years, I suspect that it is difficult to know exactly what one’s role on the NAACL Executive Board will look like before serving. Knowing that, I am reluctant to promise any sort of sweeping or inspiring change should I be elected. Instead, I can only assure you that I am a big fan of NAACL and its initiatives, such as the emerging regions fund. If elected, I will do my utmost to maintain and enhance these services, especially those that affect students and under-represented regions, which are the main drivers for NAACL’s continued growth.
