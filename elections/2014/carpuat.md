#### Bio

Marine Carpuat is a Research Officer at the National Research Council Canada, where she works on Machine Translation and Semantics. She received a PhD from the Hong Kong University of Science & Technology in 2008, before moving to North America as a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University. Marine has served as an area chair for NAACL 2013, co-organizer of the SIGMT/SIGLEX Workshop on Syntax, Semantics and Structure Statistical Translation since 2011, and co-chair of the ACL Student Research Workshop in 2006. She was also a communities volunteer at the 2013 Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing.

#### Candidacy Statement

My goal is to promote and improve the strengths of NAACL as an inclusive and diverse community. I would like to focus on two directions:

1. Continue to improve and streamline the reviewing process to guarantee a high quality technical program and constructive feedback to authors.
2. Use the conference to catalyze the growth of our community year-round and throughout the Americas. This can be done by creating mentoring programs for students and researchers of under-represented groups, by encouraging interactive discussion around open-access online content (videos of talks are a great start, but we could also further promote posters, tutorials, code and data), in addition to the existing regional meetings fund, summer schools and NACLO.
