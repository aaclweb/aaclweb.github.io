### [Julia Hockenmaier](http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/~juliahmr/)

#### Bio

Julia Hockenmaier is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Her research interests include using expressive grammar formalisms for statistical parsing and grammar induction, applying parsing algorithms to model protein folding, and, more recently, developing models of automatically describing images in natural language. She received her PhD from the University of Edinburgh under the supervision of Mark Steedman, and did a postdoc with Aravind Joshi at the University of Pennsylvania. She is a current member of the Computational Linguistics editorial board, was on the Senior Program Committee for NAACL-HLT 2007, and is a regular member of the program committee for the various ACL conferences. She has participated in ACL/EACL/NAACL student research workshops as author, student organizer and faculty adviser, and was a member of the first EACL student board.

#### Candidacy Statement

As a member of the NAACL Executive Board, I would like to work towards: (1) maintaining the status of the main conference as an important place to present research, exchange ideas, and catch up with colleagues. I believe physical meetings are essential for the vitality of our community, even if their status may change in the age of electronic journals. (2) turning the Student Research Workshop from a place to present work that isn't quite ready for the main conference into a venue that promotes excellence in graduate research, and foster a sense of community among the next generation of CL/NLP researchers. Overall, the traditional SRW is rather ineffective, because it only reaches a very small fraction of the grad student population. I believe we should explore other formats, such as a doctoral consortium with a few oral presentations from more senior students, a larger poster session for more junior students, and perhaps panel sessions with senior researchers on topics of interest. (3) making sure NAACL has a voice in public discussions that concern, and may shape, the future of computer science research and education in North America. I believe that (NA)ACL should consider joining the Computing Research Association (CRA), which would allow us to participate in such discussions, along with other professional societies such as AAAI, ACM, or SIAM.
