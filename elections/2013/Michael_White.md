### [Michael White](http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~mwhite/)

#### Bio

Michael White is an Associate Professor in the Department of Linguistics at The Ohio State University. Since obtaining his Ph.D. in Computer and Information Science from the University of Pennsylvania, he has worked for many years in the fields of natural language generation and dialogue systems, first at CoGenTex, Inc., then across the pond at the University of Edinburgh, and most recently at Ohio State. He has served as local sponsorship chair for ACL 2008 and publications co-chair for ACL 2012, served on the SIGGEN board and Computational Linguistics editorial board, and led OSU's NACLO hosting activities. Though capable of no special wizardry with spreadsheets, he did manage to organize an NSF workshop on shared tasks in NLG and the INLG 2008 conference without running over budget.

#### Candidacy Statement

The last time NAACL elected a new treasurer, the candidate admitted that he was running in large part because a friend twisted his arm. In the same spirit of transparency, I'll be honest and say I'm running mostly because I was asked nicely to do so. If elected, I'll continue Chris Manning's efforts to get NAACL to do more to support the field while keeping member fees low. (This challenging task may or may not involve cutting fees for our richest members without running deficits.) I can see from the board member candidacy statements that there are many initiatives worth supporting; from my own perspective, I am particularly keen to support development and outreach efforts for students, including continued support for the NACLO competition, as well as efforts to encourage collaborations with linguists and cognitive scientists, who are becoming increasingly aware of the relevance of computational methods developed in the CL community to the scientific study of language and cognition.
