### [William Schuler](http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~schuler/)

#### Bio

William Schuler has been an associate professor of linguistics at The Ohio State University since 2010. Before that he was an associate professor of computer science at the University of Minnesota. He received his PhD in computer and information science from the University of Pennsylvania in 2003. His research has focused on human-like language processing based on computational models of memory, funded by a National Science Foundation CAREER award since 2005. In 2006 this project received a PECASE award from the NSF. Last year he served as publications co-chair of NAACL 2012.

#### Candidacy Statement

I have long been interested in mathematical models of human language, not only from a software engineering perspective, as one who hopes to apply these models, but also from a theoretical linguistic and cognitive scientific perspective, as one who hopes to inform these models. I think these communities have much untapped potential for collaboration. As a NAACL board member I would act to encourage interdisciplinary work by computer scientists, linguistics, and cognitive scientists.
