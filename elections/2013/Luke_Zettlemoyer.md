### [Luke Zettlemoyer](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~lsz/)

#### Bio

Luke Zettlemoyer is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington. His research focuses on algorithms for learning to recover and make use of representations of the meaning of natural language text. He recently served as an area co-chair for NAACL and EMNLP, program co-chair for the Pacific Northwest Regional NLP workshop, and is the NAACL 2013 workshops co-chair.

#### Candidacy Statement

I would be excited to work on initiatives that grow participation in NAACL and improve the reviewing process. A few examples include: (1) standardizing a late fall paper submission deadline to eliminate conflict with ACL, (2) supporting reviewing reform efforts to minimize redundant effort while adding new tools for identifying and addressing poor quality reviews before they are seen by authors, (3) supporting coordination with the TACL journal including TACL paper talks at NAACL, and finally (4) increasing NAACL's support for the summer school, regional workshops, and the computational linguistic olympiad to grow student participation.
