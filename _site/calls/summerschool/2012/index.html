<p>The North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL) is again offering an exciting summer school opportunity for a limited number of graduate and undergraduate students interested in the field of Human Language Technology.</p>

<p>The summer school will be held from Monday June 27 - Friday July 8, 2011, at The Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP) at Johns Hopkins University in conjunction with the pre-workshop classes of the CLSP 2011 Summer Workshop on Language Engineering. Selected students will attend two weeks of lectures and hands-on laboratories that will include general introductions to the major areas of study within the field of Human Language Technology (e.g. Natural Language Processing, Automatic Speech Recognition, Machine Translation, Information Retrieval) as well as sessions on specialized research topics of current interest in the field.</p>

</ul>

<p>The APPLICATION DEADLINE is Friday, May 5 2012, at 5pm Eastern Time.</p>

<p>Students must be enrolled or pre-enrolled at an institution in the Americas to qualify. Preference will be given to high-quality students at a stage in their careers during which attendance at the summer school will provide maximum benefit; in particular, graduate students in their initial years of study and undergraduates who have completed their junior or senior years of study. Postdoctoral applications will not be accepted. Selected students are expected to attend both weeks of the summer school. Students who are selected for the summer school are expected to attend both weeks.</p>

<p>Scholarships: In addition to providing summer school registration fees for all selected attendees, a limited number of scholarships to cover additional costs (in particular, travel expenses to the workshop venue and/or accommodation for the full duration) may be available. We intend to cover full or partial costs for these two items for at least some applicants. Funds are limited, however, so if you are a graduate student, please ask your advisor to contribute to the funding.</p>

<h3 id="frequently-asked-questions-faq">Frequently-asked Questions (FAQ):</h3>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: I am currently attending a university that is not in North America. Can I apply?
<strong>A</strong>: As stated above, no. Since this is a NAACL sponsored event, it is only available to students enrolled or pre-enrolled in institutions located in the Americas. This includes North, Central, and South America as well as the Caribbean.</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: Must all materials be submitted by the deadline, including the letters of recommendation?
<strong>A</strong>: Yes, the deadline applies to the entire application package. The letters of recommendation can be short (1-2 paragraphs), and your recommenders can email them in directly.</p>

<p><strong>Q</strong>: What does the scholarship include?
<strong>A</strong>: In all cases the scholarship will include the registration fee to the summer school. Then, depending on available funds and the details of your application we may award funding for housing in the JHU residence halls, and some of your travel expenses. Please note though that travel awards are typically sufficient for air travel from major US airports to Baltimore. If you are coming from a smaller city or outside of the USA you may need to provide additional funds to cover the total cost of travel. Also note that the scholarship does not include meals, which you will need to purchase on your own at JHU or in the surrounding area.</p>
