<p>The North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL) is again offering an exciting summer school opportunity for a limited number of undergraduate students interested in the field of Human Language Technology.</p>

<p>The 2016 Jelinek Summer Workshop will be held from Monday, June 13 to Friday, August 5, 2016 at the University of Washington at Seattle, WA. The first two weeks of the workshop, from June 13 to June 24, 2016, is a summer school that provides general introductions to the major areas of study within the field of Human Language Technology (e.g., Natural Language Processing, Automatic Speech Recognition, Machine Translation, Information Retrieval) as well as sessions on specialized research topics of current interest in the field. The NAACL scholarship is used to support undergraduate students to participate in the two-week summer school.</p>

<p>The summer workshop schedule from last year can be found here:
<a href="http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/15-workshop/">http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/15-workshop/</a></p>

<p>Details about the 2016 summer school will be posted here shortly:
<a href="http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/16-workshop/">http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/16-workshop/</a></p>

<p>The NAACL Scholarship application deadline is April 30, 2016, at 11:59pm PDT. This is a very firm deadline, and applications submitted prior to this date will be much appreciated.</p>

<p>The application form appears at the end of this message.</p>

<p>Students must be enrolled or pre-enrolled at an institution in the Americas to qualify. Preference will be given to high-quality undergraduate students at a stage in their careers during which attendance at the summer school will provide maximum benefit; in particular, undergraduates who have completed their junior or senior years of study. Graduate and Postdoctoral applications will not be accepted. Students who are selected for the summer school are expected to attend all two weeks of the summer school.</p>

<p>Scholarships: The scholarship is in amount of $2,000 per student. $1700 of this covers the mandatory registration and housing costs as well as a meal plan for the full duration. In addition, up to $300 will be given to the student to offset travel and other incidental costs. Additional travel support may be available for students with exceptionally high travel costs.</p>

<h3 id="frequently-asked-questions-faq">Frequently-asked Questions (FAQ):</h3>
