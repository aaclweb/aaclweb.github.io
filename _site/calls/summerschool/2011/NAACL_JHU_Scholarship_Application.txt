option, or an undergraduate student, this letter should come from
a faculty member who knows your background in NLP or related areas
relatively well. 

The letter can be short (1-2 paragraphs).  It should say state how
your recommender feels you would benefit from the experience,  
whether you have similar opportunities at your university, and whether
your background gives you adequate preparation for the summer school. 
Please ask that this letter be sent directly to naacl.jhu.2011@gmail.com. 
An email is fine, there is no need for a letterhead PDF. Please have
your recommender write your name in the subject line.
