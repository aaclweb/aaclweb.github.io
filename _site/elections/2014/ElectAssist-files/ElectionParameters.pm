# $contact_link. As for the latter, you can  provide an http address,

# or an email address, such as in
# $contact_link = "mailto:me\@whatever.foo?Subject=It's all messed up";

# For the ballot sanity checks, you must provide a list of all items
# (names of form elements on the ballot form) that are
# actually election items. The names must exactly match

# ATTENTION: fields starting with `comment' (in any # combination of

# file. Make sure that you choose appropriate field names
# for comment fields (if any) in the ballot form.

# %ballot_item_labels maps from the ballot item names (also used for

# per voter for any particular item. If no value is defined, index.cgi
# will refuse to accept any vote that specifies more than ONE option
# for the respective field. The field names must be IDENTICAL to the
# form field names used in the ballot.  For example, if voters can
# vote for two people for "Executive Committee", add the following:
# $maxvotes{"Executive Committe"} = 2;
$maxvotes{"Chair"} = 1;
$maxvotes{"Secretary"} = 1;
$maxvotes{"BoardMember"} = 2;
# The threshold hash allows you to define the minimum percentage
# of votes that a ballot item needs to 'win'
# samples:
# $threshold{"First Amendment"}{"approve"} = 2/3;
# $threshold{"President"}{"*"} = .5;
# the first line means that the First Amendment passes only with a 2/3
# majority, the second that any candidate for president wins if
# he or she gets at least 50% of the votes.
