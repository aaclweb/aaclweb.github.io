<h4 id="bio">Bio</h4>

<p>In January 2013 I joined the faculty of Department of Computer Science at the George Washington University. Previously, I was Research Scientist (Principal Investigator) at the Center for Computational Learning Systems at Columbia University. I am co-founder of the Columbia Arabic Dialect Modeling group at Columbia (CADIM). I work on (lexical) semantics, Machine Translation, Arabic NLP, Multilingual Processing, and automated social media processing. I have been heavily involved in multiple organizational tasks in the context of conferences, workshops, and tutorials. I also co-founded *SEM conference and served as the General Chair for the 2nd Edition in *SEM 2013. I am the outgoing President of ACL SIG Semitic, and the newly elected President of SIGLEX. Before joining Columbia in 2005, I did my postdoctoral work with Dan Jurafsky at Stanford University. I earned my PhD in Computational Linguistics from UMD-College Park in 2003 under the supervision of Philip Resnik.</p>

<p>I would like to continue on the board to serve the community in several aspects:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I am most concerned with the reviewing process and the duplication of effort this involved to date. I would be very interested in helping devise mechanisms of recycling and streamlining paper reviews in such a way that lightens the burden on the reviewers but also provides thorough feedback to authors;</li>
  <li>I am interested in creating more links with students (especially women) by increasing their participation via dedicated sessions but also via creating more technical mentoring opportunities and potential job placement sessions;</li>
  <li>I think we should strive to create solid links to the industrial world without losing sight of the theoretical underpinnings of computational linguistics, linguistics, and cognition by promoting sound scientific exploration that could have interesting implications on our understanding of natural language and the human mind. This goal can be achieved via papers/ opinion papers (which already exist) but also encourage panel discussions similar to workshop sessions;</li>
  <li>I would like to help increase the visibility of NAACL beyond North America into Latin America and work on facilitating the visibility of NAACL in Africa and the Middle East;</li>
  <li>NAACL is at the forefront of our conferences and I believe it should play a significant role in popularizing our science beyond the technical confines of our conferences/academia/industry to more lay venues allowing for more creative advertising for our field.</li>
</ol>
