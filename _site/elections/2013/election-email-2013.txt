nominee and giving evidence that he or she will serve if elected.
(It is recommended that this evidence consist of a forwarded email
from the nominee containing a candidate statement, a biographical
sketch, homepage URL, and a brief affirmation of intent to serve
if elected.) In addition, the nominees for Chair should meet the
criteria set out in the NAACL constitution.

Election process:

The voting period will begin once the final slate of candidates and
voting instructions are announced (soon after November 30th), and
is scheduled to close on December 20th.

Many thanks to the Nominating Committee -- Hal Daume (Chair), Ted
Pedersen, Suzanne Stevenson, Chris Brew, Kristina Toutanova, Owen
Rambow -- for doing the hard work of putting together an excellent
slate of nominees.
