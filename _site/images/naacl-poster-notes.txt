The map for the poster was built on Google Maps.

Here is the public map for the NAACL conferences from maps.google.com (it is a map served from Anoop Sarkar's google account):

The KML file is in the current directory: googlemaps-naacl.kml

(unsure if this will be enough to transfer to another service or not but it is the only download that maps.google.com provides.
