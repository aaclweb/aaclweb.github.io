<ul>
  <li>TACL papers presented.
    <ul>
      <li>6 papers split up into 4 oral and 2 poster (same percent as NAACL papers). In the future, it may well be that all TACL papers will be oral. An alternative is for TACL reviewers to decide poster versus oral at time of acceptance.</li>
      <li>Papers accepted to NAACL first, then TACL papers added to program. This does not scale.</li>
      <li>The TACL website might be more explicit about the type of presentation TACL authors will have at ACL or NAACL. Right now there is no explicit mention that “presentation” may be poster as well as oral.</li>
      <li><strong>ACTION ITEM</strong> CCB will contact the TACL editors about revising their website.</li>

<h3 id="acceptance-rates-question-from-ted-pedersen">Acceptance Rates: Question from Ted Pedersen</h3>

<p>Two requests from Ted:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Report per-area acceptance for NAACL.
    <ul>
      <li>This is already done during the business meeting of NAACL. Perhaps can be posted online as well.</li>
      <li><strong>ACTION ITEM</strong> CCB to see if the per area acceptance rates can be posted online. Perhaps the general chair report can just include these stats and we would put that online as a matter of course.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The influence of <code class="highlighter-rouge">*SEM</code> on NAACL.
    <ul>
      <li>This was discussed in the previous point about co-located conferences and workshops.</li>

<p>Discussion on the adoption of the <a href="http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Anti-harassment">SIGPLAN Conference Anti-Harassment Policy</a> by the NAACL conferences.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Graeme shared the discussion at the ACL exec on this matter.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>ACTION ITEM</strong> The NAACL Board voted to accept a suitably modified version of the SIGPLAN policy and change it to ask anyone who thinks they are affected by the actions covered by this policy to contact any person of the NAACL board or Priscilla Rasmussen.</p>

<h3 id="lsa-strategic-planning-ccb">LSA strategic planning: CCB</h3>

<p>LSA sent us an email with survey questions to get the perspective of computational linguists to NAACL.</p>

<p><strong>ACTION ITEM</strong> CCB will email the questions to the board. CCB and Emily will answer the questions (including feedback from members of the board).</p>

<h3 id="post-conference-survey-ccb">Post conference survey: CCB</h3>

<p>A survey collecting information from NAACL attendees will be sent out. The results will help us plan for future NAACLs.</p>

<h3 id="discuss-gcpc-chairs-for-naacl-2015">Discuss GC/PC Chairs for NAACL 2015</h3>

<p>Discussion about picking general chair and program chairs for NAACL 2015.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="decisions-made-over-email">Decisions made over email</h2>

<h3 id="apr-30-2013">Apr 30, 2013</h3>

<p>The NAACL board unanimously voted to approve funding of $5000 for NACLO in 2013 as in previous years.</p>

<h3 id="mar-14-2013">Mar 14, 2013</h3>

<p>Matt Post, the publications co-chair for NAACL 2013 proposed the creation of a digital version of the program handbook for NAACL 2013. This would be a mobile app that would allow conference goers to view and organize their schedules, see which talks are being held where, and provide the information that a hard copy program handbook usually provides. The chair (Chris Callison-Burch) called for discussion on this proposal on Mar 11, 2013.</p>

<p>There was a discussion among the board members. The issue of cost came up. There is a savings of $10K from discontinuing thumb drives for distributing the proceedings. We cannot save money on printing fewer hard copy program hanbooks as there is a contract in place with Omnipress to have handbooks printed this year for all attendees of NAACL 2013 (at a cost of around $3,800, about $4.50 per book). So, this year, we cannot give the option to either have the mobile app or the hardcopy program handbook. But in future conferences, there is the potential to save on printing costs if most people will use the app version of the program handbook. The development of the app for NAACL 2013 was priced at $6900 from CrowdCompass.</p>

<p>The board unanimously approved the expenditure for the development of the program handbook app for NAACL 2013 (only Rebecca Hwa abstained but she was away from her email). Chris Callison-Burch negotiated a better price than the earlier quote with the price for two conferences (this year’s NAACL and the next year’s) for $5K each. The board hopes to recover $7K extra this year, either from registration fees or from increased sponsorships to cover the additional cost.</p>

<h3 id="feb-4-2013">Feb 4, 2013</h3>

<p>Chris Callison-Burch called for a discussion and subsequent vote on discontinuing thumb drives at NAACL conferences.</p>

<p>Matt Post, one of this year’s publications co-chairs has been in contact with our publisher (Omnipress) about producing the thumb drives. He provided them with an initial estimate of 850 USB thumb drives, based on previous years’ attendance. The estimate for producing and shipping the drives is $8,580 ($10.09 per drive).</p>

<p>Matt suggested that we should consider discontinuing the thumb drive or making it an optional extra that could be added at the time of registration, and that the savings could be re-directed to other distribution means (e.g. better WiFi on-site, or an App for interacting with the proceedings and conference schedule).</p>

<p>This matter discussed with the NAACL-HLT 2013 Program Chairs and General Chair. It was pointed out that when Hal Daume was the publication chair for ICML, they disbanded the memory sticks. There were few complaints and the saved a lot of money.</p>

<p>The vote was taken by email and the following members voted YES.</p>

<p>Votes in favor:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Emily Bender</li>
  <li>Chris Callison-Burch</li>
  <li>Mona Diab</li>
  <li>Katrin Erk</li>
  <li>Julia Hirschberg</li>
  <li>Rebecca Hwa</li>
  <li>Anoop Sarkar</li>
  <li>Joel Tetreault</li>
</ul>

<p>Abstained:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Graeme Hirst</li>
</ul>

<p>There were no NO votes, so NAACL is going to implement this motion.</p>

<p>A few points arose during the discussion.</p>

<ul>
  <li>We hope to have a few thumb drives in the registration desk for people to make copies into their devices.</li>
  <li>We hope there will be a possibility to cache the proceedings on the local network obviating large fees for downloading the proceedings over the hotel wifi network.</li>
</ul>
