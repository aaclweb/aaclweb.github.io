  <li><a href="NAACL_Treasurers_Report_2011.pdf">Link to Treasurer’s report</a></li>
  <li>NAACL 2010 – strategies to prevent huge losses in the future.
    <ol>
      <li>NAACL 2010 in LA led to a huge loss, roughly half of the contingency fund was depleted.</li>
      <li>The various reasons were discussed including the lower than expected registration and the budget negotiated with the hotel.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Discussion on the proposed financial redistribution with respect to ACL (discussion led by Graeme Hirst who is ACL treasurer)
    <ol>
      <li>The proposed change would lead to a less control by NAACL over the overall NAACL budget which would be controlled by ACL, but ACL would continue to shoulder the risk at a conference loss.</li>
      <li>This would amortize risk across the different ACL chapters (NAACL and EACL) to a central ACL budget</li>
      <li>After discussion, no particular decision was reached.</li>

<ol>
  <li>Montreal Sheraton for the week of June 3 – June 8.</li>
  <li>Guy Lapalme and Sabine Bergler have both agreed to be on the advisory committee.</li>
  <li>Discussion issuess:
    <ol>
      <li>The board discussed the handling of double submissions. Current solution: general double submission ok, but not with ACL</li>
      <li>The board discussed potential problems with having the submission deadline one week before ACL deadline? It was proposed to discuss this further with the program chairs and general chair.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>GCC – Jennifer Chu-Carroll has agreed to be the general conference chair</li>

<h2 id="aclnaacl-2014">ACL/NAACL 2014</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Bid just went out. Haifeng Wang is the coordinating committee chair.</li>
  <li>Appoint Sponsorship Committee Representative
    <ol>
      <li>We have two reps: currently Michael Gamon (2010-2012) and Patrick Pantel (2011-2013).</li>
      <li>We replace one each year – term begins in August.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="nomination-committee-reform">Nomination Committee Reform</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Draft a short job description written up for each Board position. TO DO (Anoop)
    <ol>
      <li>Draft nomination letter template:</li>
      <li>The aforementioned restriction on serving in various conference capacities.</li>
      <li>The aforementioned fact that nominees are committing to three years on the Nominating Committee after their Board service, if elected.</li>
      <li>That they will need to write a candidacy statement and biosketch, and by what date.</li>
      <li>The expectation that they will attend the Board meetings that occur at the annual NAACL conferences, at their own expense</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Draft initial wordings of constitution changes (circulate within the Board for comments).
    <ol>
      <li>Idea: past board members should expect 2-3 years of commitment. Members may leave after 2 years if nomcom has at least 3 members without them. This happens in practice anyway as busier members of the official nom-com committee do not contribute as much as those who can spare the time.</li>

  <li>JHU Summer School
    <ol>
      <li>2011 with budget $10,000, point person (Ted in 2010, Chris CB in 2011)</li>
      <li>2010 Current schedule: deadline April 1st, decision April 22nd. We received 23 applications to our call. We were also willing to consider up to 10 “near miss” students from the JHU summer workshop application process, but only 2 of them expressed interest in the scholarship program (and so they were added to the pool, bringing the total number of applications evaluated to 25). Seven students were funded, six with “full” scholarships for travel, registration and lodging, and one local student got a registration only scholarship.</li>
      <li>Fate of videos from 2010? Did we fund that?? Were they recorded, and will they be made available?</li>
      <li>Call for scholarship applications posted to corpora, ir-list, naacl list, naacl-latin-america list Feb 26. Call also posted on web page by Anoop.</li>
      <li>Five of seven students responded to our survey, results mailed to board members July 19. TDP</li>
      <li>Fate of videos from 2008 and 2009 (recorded but not distributed) and plans for 2010. Updated by Ted : As of Feb 21 CCB has uploaded some of the video content from summer 2009, and has replaced Jason E. as JHU contact person.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>NACLO (north american computational linguistics olympiad – for high schoolers, budget $5000)
    <ol>
      <li>[ChrisM: Unless we’re taking a more pro-active role, I’m not sure that this needs a point person. Up until now, I’ve just written a check every year, and the organizers have dealt with contacting NLP people and encouraging them to sign up to host competitions, etc.]</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>LSA Linguistic Institute 2011
    <ol>
      <li>STATUS – Thanks to Anoop Sarkar and Kristina Toutanova for the ad design.</li>
      <li>We agreed to sponsor the program at $10K.</li>
      <li>We will not be selecting graduate student fellowships. We will sponsor courses.</li>

  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="sponsorship-representatives">Sponsorship representatives</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Background: overall organization is that there is an ACL-wide sponsorship committee that consists of two regional representatives from each chapter. Each representative serves for two years. The terms are staggered so that we need to recommend one person every year.</li>
  <li>STATUS:
    <ol>
      <li>Our current two representatives are: Srini Bangalore (2009-2011) and Michael Gamon (2010-2012). Srini will be replaced by Patrick Pantel this July.</li>
      <li>Past representatives Christy Doran (2009-2010).</li>

      <li>NAACL had an industrial panel at NAACL-HLT 2010</li>
      <li>Some feedback from business meeting: people would like to see more involvement from industry members who are not affiliated with a large research lab</li>
